##  What I Did

- Initialized a Git repository locally and pushed it to GitHub.
- Created and worked with 3 branches: `main`, `dev`, and `feature`.
- Made changes in the `feature` branch and merged using **Pull Requests** to `dev`, and then to `main`.
- Added a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.
- Tagged the release using `git tag v1.0`.
- Documented important Git concepts in `GIT_CONCEPTS.md`.
