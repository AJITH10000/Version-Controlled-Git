# Git Concepts

## What is Git?
A distributed version control system to track and manage code changes.

## Merge vs Rebase
- **Merge**: Adds a merge commit, keeps all history.
- **Rebase**: Rewrites history to place your changes on top.

## What is a Pull Request?
A request to merge one branch into another using GitHub.

## How to resolve merge conflicts?
- Edit conflicting files manually
- Use `git add <file>`
- Then `git commit` to finalize resolution

## What are Git Tags?
Used to mark specific versions/releases.

## What is Git Workflow?
A branching strategy (like feature → dev → main).

## Explain git stash
Temporarily saves your changes for later use.

## What is .gitignore used for?
Tells Git to ignore files and folders you don’t want to track.
